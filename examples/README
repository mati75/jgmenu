EXAMPLE FILES
=============

Most example scripts need to be run from the examples/ directory.

ex0* are for testing purposes.
  - They are intended to be used by invoking `make && make ex` from the top
    level directory whilst coding
  - They use ../jgmenu, so do not require a `make install`.
  - They are not designed to look pretty, but to test specific features or
    properties.
  - They may change over time depending on what the devs need.
