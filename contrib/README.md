contrib/ software
=================

The tools / helpers in this directory:

-   are stand-alone, hopefully interesting and sometimes experimental;

-   have sometimes been entirely contributed by others;

-   are not installed by `make install`;

-   may have completely different dependencies to the core jgmenu application (e.g. ff-bookmarks depends on sqlite3 and arguably also firefox/iceweasel);

-   do not always adhere to the jgmenu coding guidelines.

The tools in this directory are included in the git-repo to give users easier access to them.

Although I will try to maintain this code, my main focus will remain on
the jgmenu app itself (top level directory code).
