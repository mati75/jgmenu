* Support i18n for prepend.csv and append.csv
* Use desktop specific flags
* Add 'comment' to `csv_name_format` (%c)
* Triple quote all variables if they contain commas (not just name and exec)
* Apply `csv_name_format` to directories too
* Fix bug: `JGMENU_NO_DIRS=1` with append and prepend doesn't work
* If no menu file or no root dir, write tempfile with &lt;All /&gt;. This allows lx to run even if no menu package exists (albeit without directories).
* Read the above temp file if "--no-dir" specified (puts item in alphabetical order without having to do a qsort)
* Deal with xfce-applications.menu. Currently libmenu-cache can't read it because the root-item has the wrong name.
* Support `JGMENU_SINGLE_WINDOW=1`
* Check that .desktop files are not Unicode in order to avoid segfault (add unit test)
* Write some unit tests (incl. nested menus)
* Cope with desktop-file without exec field
