The man pages are commited in order to save you installing pandoc if
you haven't got it. Any changes are to be made to the md files.

Set text width to 69 for consistent formatting on 80x25 and bigger.

Use non-breaking spaces (\u00A0) at the beginning of lines if indentation is
required in a non-"code" area, for example the "usage" lines under SYNOPSIS.
In vim, this is achieved by ^KNS or ^K<space><space>
