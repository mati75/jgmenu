jgmenu v0.3.1 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.3
------------------
  - Added initial support for icon cache.

    This is currently just in the form of symlinks, but it does speed
    up the loading of icons when jgmenu is started.
    
  - Added support for xpm icons.

  - Improved icon-find.c search algorithms and fixed some bugs.
