jgmenu v0.8.2 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.8.1
--------------------

  * Check libmenu-cache version during build. Do not compile lx if
    libmenu-cache <v1.1 (thanks @2ion for advice on this)

  * Remove single window mode. It will be replaced by a cleaner, more
    flexible implementation.
