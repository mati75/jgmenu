jgmenu v2.0 release notes
=========================

Updates since v1.6
------------------

New features

  * Support ^filter() markup, whereby ^filter(foo) in the command field
    invokes a search for the inner value 'foo'

  * filter: support multi-word search. Words separated by a space will be
    treated as separate strings and searched for on an OR logic basis. A
    standalone '*' matches everything

  * Improve widgets API and fix minor issues

      - add @text type (to insert text)

      - draw @rect fill and border in correct order, i.e. border on top of
        fill

      - when drawing selection borders, use color_sel_border rather than
        color_sel_fg

  * lx: output application categories as metadata

    Categories as taken from the desktop files' "Categories" field and
    each category is prepended by a '#'

    For example, xterm.desktop contains the line

        Categories=System;TerminalEmulator;

    The fifth CSV field therefore becomes "#System#TerminalEmulator"

  * Add the following config options

      - 'color_scroll_ind' to enable setting the colour of the lines
        indicating that menu items exist outside those which are visible.

      - 'csv_i18n' to specify translation file/directory for the ob
        module

  * Add greeneye module

    'jgmenu_run greeneye' outputs a config file and widget lines for a
    menu with the following layout:

        +----------------+-----------------------+
        |                |  a - search box       |
        |                |-----------------------|
        |                |                       |
        | b - categories |                       |
        |                |  c - applications     |
        |                |                       |
        |                |                       |
        +----------------+-----------------------+

    Example usage

        jgmenu_run greeneye --config >$HOME/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc
        jgmenu_run greeneye --widgets >$HOME/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv

Prepare for OpenBSD port

  * util.c: remove strcat() (commit 38e4e11a)

  * xsettings.c:231: use snprintf() (commit 26ea4c2d)

  * init: replace "tar -T" as it is not POSIX (commit 4ad9fcff)

Fix bugs and issues

  * Fix KeyError bug in pmenu module (commit 3b4ba92)

  * Handle missing xsettings variables. If xsettings is running but does
    not contain Gtk/FontName or Net/IconThemeName, we proceed to the next
    icon/theme fallback.

  * i18n: support dirirectory name without '/' at end

  * ob: quote output correctly (issue #76). This avoids causing a crash
    when opening directory names with spaces when using
    bl-places-pipemenu. Reported-by: @johnraff

  * debian/rules: omit broken dh_auto_clean target (and add some
    buildflags). Provided-by: @2ion

Cody clean up. The changes below break backward compatibility, although
it is believed that the majority of users will not notices these changes.

  * Retire 'xdg' module (now in noncore/). Its functionality is covered
    by pmenu and lx.

  * Do not install 'ff-bookmarks' and 'places', just leave them in
    noncore/ for reference or manual install. These are not considered
    part of the core application and are too time-consuming to maintain
    across OSs.

  * Tidy up init module

      - remove {ap,pre}pend.csv files when setting new theme

      - remove tint2 related code (because it seems simplier to just
        handle jgmenu config files)
