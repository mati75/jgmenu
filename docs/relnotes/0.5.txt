jgmenu v0.5 release notes
=========================

Updates since v0.4.5
--------------------

  - Added support for the following:
	- items with different heights (e.g. ^sep())
	- automatic detection of menu width
	- separator with text
    
  - Added these config options:
	- color_menu_border
	- color_sel_border
	- sep_height
	- color_sep_fg
	- csv_cmd
    
  - This is the first time we've done some regression. The following
    config items were removed:
	- max_items (does not make sense with variable height)
	- min_items (as above)

  - Added support for "stay_alive" mode and added config options
	- stay_alive
	- hide_on_startup
    and associated command line arguments
	- --stay-alive
	- --hide-on-startup

  - Significantly improved icon lookup performance (thanks o9000)

  - Simplified jgmenu_run usage. If no argument is specified,
    jgmenu_run now does one of the following:
	- Shows the menu if an instance of jgmenu is already running
	- Starts jgmenu in 'stay-alive' mode (i.e. as a long-running
	  application) using pmenu unless otherwise specified by
	  'csv_cmd' in jgmenurc

  - Added the "start" and "restart" commands to jgmenu_run
