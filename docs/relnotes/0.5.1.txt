jgmenu v0.5.1 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.5
------------------

  - Changed the following to be default behaviours:
	- Read tint2rc and apply config settings
	- Start jgmenu as a long-running application ('stay_alive')

  - Added the following config options (see JGMENU-CONFIG(1)):
	- tint2_look
	- tint2_button
	- tint2_rules

  - Added the following command line options (see JGMENU(1)):
	--simple
	--vsimple

  - Removed the command line option '--stay-alive' (regression warning!)
    as it's now the default mode

  - Lots of minor fixes and improvements to pmenu

  - Added tint2 compatibility mode which reads tint2rc file and sets
    colours and dimensions. Global config variables are set in the
    following order (i.e. bottom of list has higher precedence):
	  - default (config.c)
	  - jgmenurc (or as specified by --config-file=)
	  - command line arguments
	  - tint2rc
    Although jgmenurc can overrule tint2rc by setting "tint2_rules = 0"

  - Added tint2 button support using a UNIX socket. This reads
    environment position variables from tint2 and aligns jgmenu to them.

  - Improved UI - for example:
	- escape key clear search
	- react to mouse-button release instead of mouse-button press
	- left arrow reverts to parent menu
	- right arrow goes to submenu

  - Improved 'Back' (icon and translation)
