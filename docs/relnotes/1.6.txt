jgmenu v1.6 release notes
=========================

Updates since v1.5
------------------

  * Resolve '\n' characters in item names (to give new line characters)

    As a result, when using the lx module, a '\n' can be included in
    csv_name_format in jgmenurc to span several lines. For example:

      csv_name_format = %n\n<span size="x-small">%g</span>

  * Amend CSV API to include 'working directory' and 'metadata'

      field #4 - working_dir (also implemented in spawn())
      field #5 - metadata (not yet used)

  * Improvements to lx module

     - Allow commas in 'name' and 'command' fields (issue #49)
       Suggested-by @Vladimir-csp

     - Add working_dir to output, taking the value from the .desktop
       files' 'Path=' field (issue #49). Suggested-by @Vladimir-csp

  * Improvements to openbox module

     - Support icons with pipe-menu entries (issue #69)
       Suggested-by: @semeion

     - Use /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml as fallback if no file is specified
       and $HOME/.config/openbox/menu.xml does not exist.

     - Add experimental i18n support. This is not yet documented, but can
       be used by taking the followint steps (replacing sv with whatever
       is appropriate for you):

         (a) Run `jgmenu_run ob | jgmenu_run i18n --init >sv`
         (b) Translate entries in file 'sv'
         (c) Run 'JGMENU_I18N=sv jgmenu' (with csv_cmd=ob in jgmenurc)

         It is enough to point the environment variable JGMENU_I18N to a
         directory containing the translation file, in which case the
         value of $LANG will be used to find the right file.

         See 'jgmenu_run i18n --help' for more details

  * Improvements to pmenu module

     - Fix markup bug, which sometimes results in breakage (apologies)
       (issue #71) Reported-by: @eoli3n

  * A number of minor fixes, most notably:

     - Escape markup characters in "<empty>" string to show correctly

     - Set menu width correctly taking into account pango markup
