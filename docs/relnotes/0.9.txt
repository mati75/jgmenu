jgmenu v0.9 release notes
=========================

Updates since v0.8.2
--------------------

  * Re-write 'init' module to make it do the following:

	- Create and amend the jgmenurc config file
	- Provide config file templates
	- Carry out some system checks which are useful when setting
	  up jgmenu

  * Add 'config' module (to support 'init')

  * Add --cmd= option to 'ob'

    This is particularly useful for pipe-menus designed for openbox,
    for example:

    cat <<'EOF' >>~/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv 
    Places,^pipe(jgmenu_run ob --cmd=al-places-pipemenu)
    EOF

  * Add 'ff-bookmarks' CSV generator (for firefox bookmarks)

  * Add jgmenututorial(7) lesson 10 on CSV generators

  * Add icon (jgmenu.svg) - thanks ArchLabs team for the inspiration

  * Simplify jgmenu.desktop

  * Reduce default mouseover hover timer from 250ms to 100ms
    Also, add config option 'hover_delay' for anyone wishing to tweak further.

  * Make pmenu handle missing menu package. If no menu-package exists, all
    apps are put in the menu's root

  * Add 'tasks' module (written-by: @Misko-2083)

    This is not yet included in the Makefile, but has been added to the repo
    as an interesting tool for the time being.

  * Makefile: handle missing dependencies better (incl libmenu-cache)

  * Give jgmenurc higher precedence than _NET_WORKAREA

  * Various minor bug fixes and updates to man pages.
