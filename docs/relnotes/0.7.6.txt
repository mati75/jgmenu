jgmenu v0.7.6 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.7.5
--------------------

NOTE: The CLI has changed. Please set csv_cmd in the config file rather
than running 'jgmenu_run lx|pmenu|xdg|ob'. If you prefer to run without
a config file, use --csv-cmd= (see man-pages for further info).

  * Remove jgmenu-{pmenu,lx,xdg,ob}* and replace with corresponding
    jgmenu-parse-{pmenu,lx,xdg,ob}* CSV commands.

  * Remove jgmenu-{xsettings,icon-find,csv,config,start}* as they have
    become redundant.

  * Read from 'csv_cmd' rather than stdin by default. This means that
    'jgmenu' can be run directly from the command line without arguments,
    piping or re-direction. stdin will be read if
      - run in --simple and --vsimple mode;
      - the config option 'csv_cmd' is empty.

  * Understand csv_cmd keywords: pmenu, xdg, lx and ob.

  * Add monitor config option.

  * Fix multi-screen positioning bugs.
