jgmenu v3.3 release notes
=========================

Updates since v3.2
------------------

  * In the obtheme module, add support for parsing BunsenLabs Lithium's
    `bl-rc.xml` to obtain the current openbox theme, thereby supporting
    `jgmenu init --apply-obtheme` without having to set an environment
    variable.
