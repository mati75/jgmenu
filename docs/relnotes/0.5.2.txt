jgmenu v0.5.2 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.5.1
--------------------

  - Add XDG menu parser based on libmenu-cache. This needs libglib2.0-dev
    and libmenu-cache-dev to build. If anyone feels that they don't want
    these dependencies, I can easily #ifdef them out. Try it using the
    command `jgmenu_run lx`. Thank you @Vladimir-csp for suggesting it.

  - Create icon cache on the fly (see docs/notes_on_icons for further
    details). With this improvement, the command `jgmenu_run cache` is
    no longer required and has therefore been removed.

  - Improved tint2 integration by parsing font and icon-theme.

  - Remove the following config options (regression):
	- ignore_icon_cache
	- show_title
	- color_noprog_fg
	- color_title_bg

  - Remove "title" support. This functionality will be replaced later
    using a more flexible approach.
