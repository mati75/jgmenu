jgmenu v0.4.5 release notes
===========================

Updates since v0.4.4
--------------------

  - Updated documentation, particularly README.md
    Added JGMENUTUTORIAL(7) and JGMENU-CONFIG(1)
    
  - Added support for openbox menus (`jgmenu_run ob`)
    Pipe-menus are faked (by spawning a new menu), but work
    reasonably well.

  - pmenu: Added internationalization support. The menu should now
    appear in your language. (Thanks o9000)

  - Added append and prepend support to pmenu (to add items to the
    root-menu)
    `jgmenu_run parse-pmenu` now understands
        --append-file=<file> and --prepend-file=<file>
    `jgmenu_run pmenu` passes on the following if they exist:
    $HOME/.config/jgmenu/{append.csv,prepend.csv}

  - Added --no-dirs options to `jgmenu_run parse-xdg`. 
    With --no-dirs, the .menu and .directory files are ignored.
    The output will be a plain list of all applications (derived from
    .desktop files) without any ^tag() and ^checkout() markup.

  - Changed installation paths in the Makefile. "jgmenu" and "jgmenu_run"
    remain in $(bindir). All other executable programmes are installed in
    $(libexecdir) as they are run by other programs rather than the user.

  - Added 'jgmenu_run init'
    This command creates a ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc if one does not
    exist. If a jgmenurc already exists, the `init` command updates it
    with any missing variables.

  - Added separator support (although it's still a bit experimental)
    Use ^sep() in first field of jgmenu-CSV
