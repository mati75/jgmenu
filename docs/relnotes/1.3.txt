jgmenu v1.3 release notes
=========================

Updates since v1.2.1
--------------------

  * Add "columns" config option

  * Account for long labels. When searching or using columns less wide
    than the description, an ellipsis (...) is added to curtail the label
    at the correct width. Thanks @Vladimir-csp for suggesting this.
    (issue #59)

  * Fix pipemenu bug which sometimes caused undefined behaviour
