jgmenu v4.4.0 release notes
===========================

Updates since v4.3.0
--------------------

  * Make --simple force short-lived mode (the way it was always intended to be
    an is described in documentation). Fixes issue #153.

  * jgmenu-apps:

      - Respect TryExec in .desktop files including the handling of absolute
        paths. Fixes issues #146 and #151. Suggested-by: @johnraff.

      - Parse .desktop file 'Path' field and support working directory
        Written-by: @BitterlyIronic.

      - Make exec[] field bigger to allow long strings (as seen in for example
        wine applications).

      - Include .desktop files in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/ sub-directories
        For example, ~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Games/

  * jgmenu-lx: escape C:\ in order to cope with libmenu-cache escaping the
    backslash in 'C:\' in wine applications' .desktop file Exec= field

  * gtktheme: call `jgmenu_run config` synchronously to avoid config file write
    errors
