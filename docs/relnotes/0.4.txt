jgmenu v0.4 release notes
=========================

Updates since v0.3.1
--------------------

  - Added man pages

  - Added support for obtaining theme and font details from the
    xsettings-daemon.

  - Re-factored jgmenu_run and added/improved the following commands:

	- csv

	- pmenu: Copied from https://gitlab.com/o9000/pmenu.git

	- cache: Now runs without having to specify menu-file; and
		 reads the icon-theme from xsettings or jgmenurc.

	- xdg:	 Improved, but still very experimental

  - Two config options were added (both are set to 0 be default)

	- ignore_xsettings

	- ignore_icon_cache (by default, icon-cache will be used if it
	  exists in ~/.local/share/icons/jgmenu-cache/)
