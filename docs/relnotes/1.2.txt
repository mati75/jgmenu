jgmenu v1.2 release notes
=========================

Updates since v1.1
------------------

  * Add config options

     - 'csv_no_dirs' - create a menu without a directory structure
       (i.e. not nested). This option applies to the lx and pmenu
       modules.

     - 'menu_height_min', 'menu_height_max' - set the min and max
       height of the root menu.

     - 'menu_height_mode' which can be either 'static' or 'dynamic'.
       'dynamic' is a new mode in which the menu height is re-calculated
       every time the root menu is redefined using ^root() (issue #57)

       A single window menu, with the height adjusting to the space
       required by the items, can be achieved with the following
       configuration:

       csv_cmd             = pmenu
       menu_height_mode    = dynamic
       hide_back_items     = 0
       csv_single_window   = 1

  * Support the keyword 'center' for menu alignment
    (using menu_valign and menu_halign)

    Try this for a launcher:

       tint2_look          = 0
       csv_cmd             = pmenu
       menu_halign         = center
       menu_valign         = center
       menu_height_min     = 500
       menu_height_max     = 500
       csv_no_dirs         = 1

  * x11-ui.c: replace xinerama with xrandr as xinerama has been reported
    to segfault with some new graphics cards (issue #60)
    (Suggested-by: @vaygr)

  * widgets: select on mouseover and enable left-click (if action has
    been specified)

  * init: add bunsenlabs_helium template (Provided-by: @johnraff)

  * Unselect items when mouse moves away from them

  * Exclude "hide-on-startup" option when restarting
