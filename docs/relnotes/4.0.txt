jgmenu v4.0 release notes
=========================

Note to package maintainers:

  * A configure script has been added, and pmenu+lx have been moved to
    contrib/. For backward compatibility run the command below before
    `make`, changing prefix to suit your system:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --with-lx --with-pmenu

    Run `./configure -h` for further help

Updates since v3.5
------------------

  * Add apps module - a replacement for pmenu and the default menu
    generator from v4.0 (hence major bump). It has the following features
    and advantages:

      * It uses built-in schema data or a specified schema file (for user
        override) to map categories to directories.

      * It provides a directory structure without the requirement for a
        menu package such as lxmenu-data or libgarcon-common, thus making
        it more likely to work out-of-the-box on many systems.

      * It is written in C and is faster than both pmenu and lx.

      * It is easier to extend and maintain compared with pmenu

      * It supports localized directory and application names

      * It avoids the mind-boggling (in my opinion) mapping relationships
        betweeen /etc/xdg/menus/* and /usr/share/desktop-directories/*
        files. For those who want a fully XDG compliant menu, the lx
        module is still supported.

      * It avoids a number of pmenu and lx issues which are difficult to
        solve. For example:

          (a) lx cache refresh sometimes does not happen until the second
              read. Whilst I feel that I ought to try to fix this bug,
              any changes to libmenu-cache would take a long time to
              appear in some repositories.

          (b) Both pmenu and lx are affected by having more than one menu
              package installed, which appears to be common on systems
              which use applications from different Desktop Environments.

          (c) libmenu-cache does not like the xfce menu package.

      * Support csv_no_dirs, csv_single_window and csv_name_format,
        making it on par with other CSV generators

  * Move pmenu and lx modules to contrib/ to make maintenance and
    packaging easier.

  * jgmenu.c: hide 'last selection border' (issue #103). Thanks @Roliga
    for pointing this out.

  * Update man pages and usage() to prefer `jgmenu_run init` over
    `jgmenu init`

  * Add banned.h to make audits easier

  * Add scripts/pbuild to simplify building deb packages with pbuilder.
    Thanks @johnraff for supplying this.

  * Add configure script in order to (a) make contrib/ packages easier
    to manange; and (b) remove dependency checking from Makefile

  * greeneye: change category 'Games' to 'Game' in order to comply with
    freedesktop.org XDG menu-spec. Thanks @jkinney23 for providing this
    fix.

  * filter.c: support case-insensitive non-ASCII search (issue #91)
    Thanks to @Vladimir-csp

  * xfce4-panel: remove gtk+-3.0 dependency
